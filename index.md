Hi.We're still getting settled into our new home at [github](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS). For now, all of our downloads can still be found at [our old home](https://pytools.codeplex.com), but our [documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/wiki) and [issue tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues) are now on github.
